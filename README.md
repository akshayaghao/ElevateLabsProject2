Project Report: College Admission Management System
Management System 
1. Introduction 
The admission process in colleges involves handling a large number of student applications, 
verifying their details, calculating merit, and allocating seats based on predefined cut-offs. 
Manual processing of applications is time-consuming and prone to errors. 
The College Admission Management System provides an automated way to manage student 
registrations, course allocation, and merit-based admissions. It ensures transparency, 
efficiency, and accuracy in handling the admission workflow. 
2. Abstract 
This project is designed to manage the end-to-end admission process of a college. Students 
register and apply for courses, the system calculates merit based on predefined criteria, and 
the admin approves or rejects applications depending on cut-off marks. The system supports 
CSV and PDF exports of the final admission list for official records. 
Key features include: 
 Student Registration 
 Course Management 
 Merit Score Calculation 
 Admission Approval/Rejection by Admin 
 Export of Approved List in CSV/PDF formats 
 Simple Console/GUI Admin Panel 
The project combines Java, JDBC, and MySQL for backend processing and uses iText 
PDF for document generation. 
3. Tools Used 
 Java (JDK 19 or later) → Core programming language for application logic. 
 JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) → To connect and interact with MySQL. 
 MySQL Database → Stores student, course, and application details. 
 iText 7 PDF Library → To generate admission lists in PDF format. 
 Apache POI / CSV Writers → To generate CSV and DOCX output files. 
 Eclipse IDE → Development environment. 
4. Steps Involved in Building the Project 
1. Database Design 
o Create tables: Students, Courses, Applications. 
o Define relationships: A student can apply to multiple courses. 
2. Student Registration 
o Form to capture student details (name, marks, contact, etc.). 
o Insert records into the Students table. 
3. Course Management 
o Admin adds courses with cut-off marks and seat availability. 
4. Application Submission 
o Students apply for available courses. 
o Record stored in Applications table with “Pending” status. 
5. Merit Calculation 
o Calculate merit score using marks/percentages. 
o Rank students for each course. 
6. Approval/Rejection 
o Admin reviews applications against cut-offs. 
o Approves eligible students and rejects others. 
7. Export Admission List 
o Generate CSV file containing approved students. 
o Generate PDF file with tabular data (using iText). 
o Ensure formatted output for record keeping. 
8. Admin Panel (Console/GUI) 
o Provide menu options for admin: 
1. Register Student 
2. Add Course 
3. Apply to Course 
4. Compute Merit 
5. Allocate Seats 
6. Export Approved List (CSV/PDF/DOCX) 
5. Conclusion 
The College Admission Management System simplifies and digitalizes the entire admission 
workflow. By using Java + JDBC + MySQL, the project ensures secure storage and 
efficient processing of student applications. The merit-based allocation ensures fairness, 
while CSV and PDF exports provide official documentation for future reference. 
This system can be extended further with a web-based interface or role-based 
authentication to handle admissions at scale.
